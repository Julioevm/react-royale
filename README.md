# React Royale

![Test](https://github.com/julioevm/react-royale/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

https://react-royale.herokuapp.com/

This is a react based client-side application that simulates a 'battle royale' type game.

The idea is to provide the ability to configure files to set up custom player rosters and events, items, etc.

In the future an actual on-line multiplayer game could be made.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn/pnpm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn/pnpm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Deployment

We're using [Heroku](https://react-royale.herokuapp.com/) for the deployment and hosting of the app.

Since it doesn't support PNPM I will still provide a yarn.lock file.
